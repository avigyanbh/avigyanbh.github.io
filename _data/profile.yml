    Hey there! I'm currently a second-year Master's (by Research) student in Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University, associated with two wonderful groups, <a href="https://theairlab.org" target="_blank">AirLab</a> (<a href="https://theairlab.org/team/wenshan/" target="_blank">Dr. Wenshan Wang</a> and <a href="https://theairlab.org/team/sebastian/" target="_blank">Dr. Sebastian Scherer</a>) and <a href="https://tbd.ri.cmu.edu" target="_blank">TBDLab</a> (<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~astein/" target="_blank">Dr. Aaron Steinfeld</a>). My primary research interest lies in Computer Vision and Multimodal LLMs, particularly in solving challenges related to scene understanding and robot navigation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before joining CMU, I earned my Bachelor's in Computer Science from Jadavpur University in India, where I worked on various core vision problems such as object detection, image segmentation and super-resolution. I also spent a year at IIT Bombay in the CMInDS department advised by <a href="https://biplab-banerjee.github.io" target="_blank">Dr. Biplab Banerjee</a>, working on how to handle out-of-distribution data in different types of vision applications using VLMs and generative models.
