abstract: >-
  We explore how synthetic data can enhance domain adaptability in self-supervised learning by leveraging InstructPix2Pix to generate semantically consistent, multi-domain image variants. By incorporating these synthetic samples into the training process, we significantly improve generalization across diverse benchmarks like DomainNet, PACS, and Office-Home. Our results highlight the promise of diffusion-based augmentation for robust SSL pre-training.
