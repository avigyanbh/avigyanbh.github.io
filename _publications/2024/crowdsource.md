abstract: >-
  Tackling the rise of AI-driven political hate speech, we propose a transparent, crowdsourced approach to content moderation that respects cultural and linguistic context—moving beyond the opaque, one-size-fits-all strategies of major platforms. Our proof-of-concept study within the Indian electoral discourse includes a richly annotated tweet dataset and highlights emerging sociopolitical patterns through statistical analysis. This democratized framework lays the groundwork for more equitable and context-aware moderation policies.
