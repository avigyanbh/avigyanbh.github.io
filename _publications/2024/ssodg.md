abstract: >-
  To tackle the challenge of generalizing from a single labeled source domain to unseen open-domain targets, we introduce a framework that learns to synthesize novel domains and generate pseudo-open samples in a principled manner. Unlike prior methods, SODG-NET enhances visual diversity and classifier robustness using a metric-driven approach, leading to consistent performance gains across multiple benchmarks in fine-grained open-closed scenarios.
