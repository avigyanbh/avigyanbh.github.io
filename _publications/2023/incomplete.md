  We propose a training strategy for MLPs to improve classification performance on incomplete data. Our method involves initial training on complete data, followed by retraining with an augmented dataset that simulates missingness using predefined imputations. Across twelve datasets and four imputation strategies, our approach consistently outperforms standard MLPs.
