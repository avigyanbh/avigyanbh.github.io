abstract: >-
  To address the risks and accessibility issues of CT scans in diagnosing pediatric abdominal pain, we explore generating synthetic CT images from orthogonal X-rays using machine learning. This approach enhances anomaly detection such as cysts and appendicitis, while reducing radiation exposure and dependence on high-end equipment. Our method yields a 9.75% performance boost over X-rays alone, showing strong potential for safer, low-resource diagnostics.
