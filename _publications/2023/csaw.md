  We introduce a method designed to enhance CLIP’s performance on domain and class generalization tasks in optical remote sensing. By combining a self-supervised loss with a novel prompt learning strategy that incorporates both domain and content-specific features, C-SAW significantly improves zero-shot generalization without fine-tuning the CLIP backbone. Our experiments show consistent gains across multiple remote sensing benchmarks.
