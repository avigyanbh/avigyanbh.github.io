abstract: >-
  Understanding whether a robot can perform a given task in a specific environment requires more than just perception—it calls for reasoning. In this work, we combine an extended IEEE CORA ontology with semantic web technologies and perception to build scene and knowledge graphs that support task feasibility analysis. The system operates in realistic simulation environments and is designed for smooth transition to physical-world deployment.
