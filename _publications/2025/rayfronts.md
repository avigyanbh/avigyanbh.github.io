  RayFronts offers a unified representation for open-set semantic mapping that bridges the gap between in-range and beyond-range perception in robotic systems. By encoding semantics into both voxels and rays, it enables efficient, fine-grained mapping and planning, even beyond sensor limits, while running in real-time. Our evaluations show significant gains in both segmentation accuracy and exploration efficiency, making RayFronts well-suited for open-world robot navigation.
