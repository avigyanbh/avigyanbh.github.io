abstract: >-
  Instead of treating text image super-resolution as a generic visual enhancement task, DEPP brings in a language-aware perspective by fusing dictionary-based probabilistic priors with recognizer outputs. This fusion enables more accurate reconstruction of medium and long words, overcoming the limitations of recognizer-driven feedback on low-res text. Evaluations on the TextZoom dataset show DEPP’s strong advantage in both perceptual quality and recognition accuracy.
