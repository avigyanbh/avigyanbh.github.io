  This paper presents JUVDsi v1, a new still image vehicle detection database tailored to Indian traffic conditions, addressing limitations in existing datasets. The database includes diverse vehicle classes captured via mobile phones and is evaluated using an ensemble of advanced object detection models. The ensemble approach, leveraging Weighted Boxes Fusion, improves detection accuracy over individual models.
